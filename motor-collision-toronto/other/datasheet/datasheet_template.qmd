abstract: "This study explores the rising incidence of motorcycle accidents in urban areas, particularly in Toronto, highlighting that rear-end collisions are most prevalent during peak traffic hours on dry roads. Despite improvements in traffic safety measures, the analysis reveals that many accidents still occur in favorable conditions, raising concerns about rider behavior and awareness. By identifying these trends, the research aims to inform targeted interventions and policy decisions to enhance road safety for all users."

**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to analyze urban traffic accidents in Toronto, specifically examining the influence of impact types, road conditions, and time of day on accident frequency and severity.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - Qingyang Feng
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - TBD
4. *Any other comments?*
    - TBD

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- The instances represent traffic collision records, which include information about the date, time, impact type, injury severity, and road conditions.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- 18,957 recorded entries
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset contains all recorded traffic incidents in Toronto since January 1, 2006
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance includes relevant attributes: date, time, accident number, impact type, and road condition.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Labels include injury severity (Fatal, Major, Minor, None).
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some records may have missing data in non-essential fields, but essential fields are preserved for analysis.
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Relationships are established through the linking of incidents to their corresponding attributes.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- TBD
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Potential inaccuracies in reported data due to police data entry variability
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset relies on the Open Data Toronto platform for data access.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Personal identifiers have been anonymized to protect the privacy of individuals involved.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- The dataset includes traffic accident data which may evoke concerns for individuals sensitive to injury or fatality statistics.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- The dataset can identify various groups based on injury severity and collision types.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- Individuals are not directly identifiable due to anonymization.
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Data reflects traffic incidents that can be distressing due to the nature of injuries involved.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- TBD

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)?
